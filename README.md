# Expanding_Cards
 This is the first project out of 50 projects learning.       
 
 I am building different projects to practice my HTML, CSS and Javascript skills.    
 I have used media queries to make it responsive, flexbox for layout and other properties like transition.    
 I have also used event listener for click event.
